üöÄ Introduction
FlickChat is more than just a messaging app. It's an experiment in building more empathetic and intuitive digital communication. In a world of text, we lose the crucial non-verbal cues that define human connection. FlickChat aims to bring them back through innovative features, creating a richer, more conscious messaging experience.

This repository chronicles the entire development journey, from initial design to a production-grade application.
